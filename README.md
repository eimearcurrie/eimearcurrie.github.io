## Project status

As of currerntly, our project is still not fully polished. We are still missing some features such as a log in menu or color modification. Also, the movies in our database is very limited. Some movies outside our database will not show when they are searched in the App. Other than these offsets, we have fully working features such as having a search bar, genre recommendations, ect.(See Feature section)
